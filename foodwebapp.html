        <h1>Best 5 Indian Foods</h1>
        <p>This is a list of Indian dishes. Many of the dishes on this list are made all across India. Indian cuisine
            encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisine native to India. Given the range of diversity in soil type,
            climate and occupations, these cuisines vary significantly from each other and use locally available
            ingredients such as: herbs, vegetables and fruits. The dishes are then served according to taste in either
            mild, medium or hot. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religious and cultural choices, like Hinduism
            and traditions. Some Indian dishes are common in more than one region of India, with many vegetarian and
            vegan dishes.
            Some ingredients commonly found in Indian dishes include: rice, wheat, ginger, green chillies and spices.
        </p>
        <p>Spicy, rich, flavourful and diverse are terms that are frequently used to describe Indian food. All these
            words are apt in describing Indian cuisine, for it is diverse in variety and taste,
            and is made up from a wide array of regional cuisines throughout various parts of India. In India as
            elsewhere, food culture is shaped by climate, land, and access to natural resources. The food system
            emphasizes eating agricultural and natural produce “in season,” such as mangoes and local greens during the
            summer, pumpkins during the rainy monsoon months,
            and root vegetables during the winter months.</p>

           <p>Biryani is popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora. It is also prepared in other regions such as parts of Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.
            Hyderabadi biryani, also known as Hyderabadi dum biryani, is a style of biryani from Hyderabad, India made with basmati rice and goat meat and cooked with the dum pukht method. Originating in the kitchens of the Nizam of Hyderabad, it combines elements of Hyderabadi and Mughlai cuisines. Hyderabad biryani is a key dish in Hyderabadi cuisine.
            Hyderabad was conquered by the Mughals in the 1630s, and ruled by its Nizams. Mughlai culinary traditions joined with local traditions to create Hyderabadi cuisine. Local folklore attributes the creation of Hyderabadi biryani to the chef of the first Nizam, Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I, in the mid 18th century, during a hunting expedition. In 1857, when the Mughal Empire declined in Delhi, 
            Hyderabad emerged as the center of South Asian culture,resulting into mix of innovations in Hyderabadi biryani.Base ingredients are basmati rice, goat meat or (sometime chicken or beef), dahi, fried onion and ghee. Spices include; cinnamon, cloves, cardamom (elaichi), bay leaves, nutmeg, papaya paste, Caraway (shahi jeera), mace flower (javitri), star anise (biryani flower),
             lemon, and saffron. Coriander leaves and garnish.

            in Manhattan. In Toronto it can be found as a filling in wraps, roti, and rolls,while in Australia, and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling. The curry is common in India and many other

        <p>Chaat or chāt is a family of savoury snacks that originated in India, typically served or at roadside tracks from stalls or food carts across the Indian subcontinent in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh. With its origins in Uttar Pradesh, India,
             chaat has become immensely popular in the rest of the Indian subcontinent. The chaat variants are all based on fried dough, with various other ingredients. The original chaat is a mixture of potato pieces, crisp fried bread dahi vada or dahi bhalla, gram or chickpeas and tangy-salty spices, with sour Indian chili and saunth , fresh green coriander leaves and yogurt for garnish, but other popular variants included aloo tikkis or samosa ,
              bhel puri, dahi puri, panipuri, dahi vada, papri chaat, and sev puri.There are common elements among these variants including dahi; chopped onions and coriander; and chaat masala, typically consisting of amchoor , cumin, kala namak , coriander, dried ginger, salt, black pepper, and red pepper. The ingredients are combined and served on a small metal plate or a banana leaf,
               dried and formed into a bowl.In cities where chaat is popular, there are popular chaathouses or dhabas, such as Mumbai's Chowpatty Beach. The chaat specialities vary from city to city. Chaat from Delhi, Lucknow, Prayagraj, Kolhapur, Varanasi, Pune, Agra, Meerut, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and Mathura are famous throughout India. In Hyderabad, chaat is mostly prepared by vendors hailing from Bihar, and is different in taste.

        <p>A dosa (also dosai or dosha) is a thin pancake or crepe, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. 
            It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance, although savoury flavours are generally emphasized (sweet variants also exist). 
            Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt, then fermented. Dosas are a common dish in South Indian 
            cuisine, but now have become popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Dosas are served hot along with chutney by tradition and sambar in recent times. 
            Other accompaniments include chutney powder (a fine groundnut and lentil powder).Dosas originated in South India; their exact birthplace in that region is a matter of conjecture.[1] In ancient times the millets were the staple food of South Indian region and not the paddy/rice. From ancient literature, scriptures and stone edicts it can be found that the rice originated from Ancient Tamilakam. The ancient Chola Nadu region is known to be the rice bowl. Most of the present day dishes like idli,
             dosai, appam, pittu/puttu are referenced in the ancient Tamil Sangam literature.</p>

        <p>Gulab jamun (also spelled gulaab jamun) is a milk-solid-based sweet, originating in Medieval Iran. and a type of mithai, popular in India, Nepal, Pakistan, the Maldives 
            (where it is known as gulab ki janu), and Bangladesh (where it is known as golap jam), as well as Myanmar. It is also common in nations with substantial populations of people 
            with South Asian heritage, such as Mauritius, Fiji, the Malay Peninsula, Great Britain, South Africa, and the Caribbean countries of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago,
             Guyana, and Suriname. It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call 
             for dried or powdered milk instead of khoya. 
            It is often garnished with dried nuts such as almonds and cashews to enhance flavour. 25th of May is celebrated as world Gulab jamun Day.In the Indian subcontinent, milk and cheese solids are prepared by heating milk over a low flame for a long time until the water content has evaporated and only the milk solids remain. 
            These milk solids, known as khoya, are kneaded into a dough, with a small amount of flour (maida)</p>
